This is an unofficial ASP.NET (MVC) adapter for [Gate](https://github.com/owin/gate).

Theoretically, it allows self-hosting of any ASP.NET application using [Katana](https://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) or any other other [OWIN](http://owin.org/)-compatible host.

Practically, it has a lot of unfinished things (no file uploads/downloads, etc) and is pretty much guaranteed to crash in complex conditions.

However it might be a good first step â€” bugs can be ironed out if this thing is useful.
